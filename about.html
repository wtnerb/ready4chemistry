            <p class="description">This page was originally built in january 2018. The purpose of the page is to help students make sure they are really ready for the third quarter of freshman chemistry for science majors. Arlene had occasionally expressed frustration with underprepared students, so she wrote the questions for a quiz and Brent built a tool to make students aware of their own readiness -- and if they have weaknesses, where those weaknesses lie. At the moment, the quiz is entirely private and no information leaves your computer when you take the quiz -- this is for you, the student, to be self aware.</p>
            <p class="description">This page is written entirely in vanilla javascript from scratch.</p>
